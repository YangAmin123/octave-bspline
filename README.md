### octave-bspline
A set of simple Octave/MATLAB functions for dealing with B-splines, designed to be relatively simple to understand and use.  Originally written for a blog post discussing B-splines in the context of Onshape - http://zmatt.net/splines-in-onshape-part-1/ - but might come in useful elsewhere.

- [bsplinebasis.m](bsplinebasis.m): Generate basis for a spline of given degree and knots
- [bsplineeval.m](bsplinebasis.m): Evaluate spline values
- [bsplineinsert.m](bsplinebasis.m): Insert a new knot into a spline
- [bsplinederiv.m](bsplinederiv.m): Return spline that is the derivative of the given spline
- [bspline_example.m](bspline_example.m): Example script showing how to generate a basis set and how to evaluate splines and their derivatives.
